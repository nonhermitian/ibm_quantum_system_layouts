# IBM Quantum system layouts

A JSON file that includes physical layout information for all IBM Quantum systems to date.

This is used by packages such as [Kaleidoscope](https://github.com/nonhermitian/kaleidoscope)
to load the latest system layouts without having to bump up the version of the main package
itself.
